Files for the Daily Journal V2

- What's the difference with the original?

    -> It uses a database (mongoose) instead of JavaScript variables
    -> Allows to delete an entire entry by just hitting the trash icon next to the entry title, also removes it from the database
    -> New home buttons to navigate faster though the page
    -> Added a new Toggle Dark Mode button, which changes the colors of the Web App to a darker theme easier for the eyes to read. (on construction)
    -> New Styling
