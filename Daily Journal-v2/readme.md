<p>Daily Journal Webapp, made using Node.js and Mongoose</p>

</div>

- Main features:

    -> New Styling

    -> It uses a database (mongoose) instead of JavaScript variables
    
    -> Allows to delete an entire entry by just hitting the trash icon next to the entry title, also removes it from the database
    
    -> New home buttons to navigate faster though the page
    
    -> Added a new Toggle Dark Mode button, which changes the colors of the Web App to a darker theme easier for the eyes to read.
    
    -> Now the page has responsiveness, it can be openend on screens smaller than 902px and the page will automatically change for the device, turning the navigation bar        into a dropdown and the switch changes into a light bulb.
